## Physics informed machine learning for AEM forward modeling

Code for 4 machine learning techniques is available (in the corresponding folders):
- Auto-encoder combined with Fourier transform
- CNN
- CNN combined with RNN
- basic code for CNN + auto-encoder combined with Fourier transform

Each folder contains a general code for the technique (_gen) and an example code in the AEM context (_ex).
The data used in the example codes is also available ().
For CNN, there is also an optimization code available (_opt).
The code for CNN + auto-encoder combined with Fourier transform is still very basis and no optimization code is given.
